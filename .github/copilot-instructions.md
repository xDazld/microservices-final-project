**Microservices Final Project**

Proposal (0%)

- Paragraph describing the application you would like to develop. -10%
  off of final grade if not submitted on time. Changes are allowed.

Design and implement a microservices application with the following
minimum requirements (85%):

- The application consists of one or more services consisting of
  multiple endpoints and an application that consumes these services
  through REST APIs and/or event streaming (Kafka, websockets).

- The application is deployed in containerized form on a cloud computing
  platform.

- Service APIs have access controls.

- The application records usage statistics for each end point, and these
  statistics are available via an administrative end point.

The minimum requirements are intended to provide you with a high degree
of flexibility.

One or more of the following additional requirements (15% + extra
credit):

- Container orchestration over multiple containers (Kubernetes).

- Use of a storage system in containerized form or from a cloud
  computing provider.

- Event streaming (Kafka).

- Cybersecurity service (this includes use of cybersecurity services
  from cloud computing providers).

- Agent based microservices

- Use of microservices testing and monitoring frameworks.

- Novel design, usefulness, and entertainment value.

- Students are rewarded for taking chances.

Submission requirements:

- A github repository with your code and a README file providing a
  description of your application, instructions for installation, and
  documentation of your api with simple use case(s).

- A report and short in-class presentation with:

    - Snapshots and short descriptions demonstrating the use of your app.

    - A performance report with response latency measurements under load
      to demonstrate some form of scalability. Note: You can do this by
      writing a test program that is able to scale up requests and record
      response latency. You can also use an off-the-shelf tool.

    - Demos are always appreciated.

    - Project post mortem.

    - Feedback on the assignment.
